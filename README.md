# The Gallery of Uninteresting Numbers

In the spirit of mathematical humor,
this gallery serves as an ironic celebration of numbers
that seem to defy the world’s obsession with finding meaning in everything.
It is a playful exploration of the concept of "interestingness"
inspired by the famous _Interesting Number Paradox_.
According to this paradox, all numbers must be interesting,
because if one were truly uninteresting,
it would itself be interesting for being uninteresting.
And so, we arrive at the idea of documenting numbers
that have somehow managed to escape human curiosity,
the ones never acknowledged by any form of media or research.

Let us celebrate the quiet, the unseen, and the forgotten numbers together.
